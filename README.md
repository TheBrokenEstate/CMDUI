# CMDUI

I'm halting development of this project until a means of toggling "Wrap text output on resize" is implemented in ctypes or the C/C++ bindings for windows CMD. At the time of writing, this is doable with the GUI settings in CMD but I have found no way of accessing this feature through the bindings. (Or at least the ones Iâ€™ve seen in the documentation.)

Perhaps prevailing circumstances will compel me to continue with this idea. Hours spent trying to find a hack for the crazy GUI explosion when resizing the window was so far unsuccessful.

The idea itself was a fun thought I had while playing fallout 4, a terminal inspired GUI, but I just don't have enough time to get it up and running at the moment. 

I have compiled all of my efforts into this folder containing the current build of CMDUI.
